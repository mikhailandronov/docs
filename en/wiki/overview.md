# {{ wiki-name }} overview

{{ wiki-full-name }} is a service to create a corporate knowledge base for company employees to populate and update.

On {{ wiki-name }} pages, you can store information that employees need for work: memos, useful links and contacts, instructions, project documentation, and personal notes. {{ wiki-name }} gives company employees additional capabilities for collaboration: they can share information, search for answers to frequently asked questions, and hold discussions in the page comment section.



## Access to {{ wiki-full-name }} {#access}

Users registered in [{{ org-full-name }}](../organization/) can work in {{ wiki-full-name }}. An organization's own knowledge base is created in {{ wiki-full-name }}, which is only accessible to its employees. To learn how to enable {{ wiki-full-name }}, see [{#T}](enable-wiki.md).

To access {{ wiki-name }}, [log in to the account](login.md) you use to work in your organization.

If a company has a system for user and access management (such as Active Directory or Google Workspace), employees can use their corporate accounts to log in to the organization in {{ yandex-cloud }} and get access to {{ wiki-name }} using a Single Sign-On (SSO) system. To do this, the administrator of the organization needs to set up an identity federation. Read more in the {{ org-full-name }} documentation under [{#T}](../organization/concepts/add-federation.md).

## {{ wiki-name }} home page {#main-page}

It is a home page of your {{ wiki-name }}, and a root page for any other page. You can edit the {{ wiki-name }} [home page]({{ link-wiki }}) just like any other page.

{% note info %}

By default, the author of the {{ wiki-name }} home page is a service account. If the **Only authors** access type is selected for this page, other users cannot access it. To allow others to access the page, click the [{{ link-homepage-access }}]({{ link-homepage-access }}) link and change the access parameters.
