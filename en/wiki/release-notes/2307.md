* [Mermaid support](#mermaid-support)

## Mermaid support {#mermaid-support}

You can now add [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams to {{ wiki-name }} pages. To insert a diagram, switch to edit mode, open the list of commands using the `/` character, and select ![](../../_assets/wiki/svg/mermaid.svg) **Mermaid**.
This option is only available in the new editor.

## Recovering deleted pages {#page-recover}

The [Revision history](../history.md) now has a **Recently deleted** tab which lists deleted pages. Select a page there to restore or permanently delete it.
