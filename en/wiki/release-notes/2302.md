# {{ wiki-full-name }} release notes: February 2023

* [Editing dynamic tables in a window of any size](#grid-window-size)
* [Setting up parameters of an embedded table](#grid-integrate)

## Editing dynamic tables in a window of any size {#grid-window-size}

You can now edit a [dynamic table](../create-grid.md) both in full-screen mode and in a window of any size.

## Setting up parameters of an embedded table {#grid-integrate}

Fixed the settings for [embedding a table](../wysiwyg/tables-format.md#section-integrate-table). Now, you can disable table edits and hide row numbers.
