# {{ wiki-full-name }} release notes: May 2023

* [Emoji support](#emoji-support)
* [Copying tables](#tables-copy)

## Emoji support {#emoji-support}

Now you can add emojis on {{ wiki-name }} pages using their text-based description. To do this, in page edit mode, type a colon (`:`) and select the emoji you need from the list. The service currently supports the basic set of emojis. In addition, in edit mode, you can now use shortcuts that will be replaced with the associated emoji when you save your changes to the {{ wiki-name }} page.
You can use emojis and shortcuts only in the new editor.

## Copying tables {#tables-copy}

The **Table settings** menu now includes the copy feature. To copy a table, open the settings in its top-right corner using ![](../../_assets/wiki/svg/settings.svg) and select **Create copy**. When copying a table, you can specify:
* Name of the copy being created
* Address at which the new table will be accessible in a browser
* Position of the new table in the page hierarchy

By default, tables are copied without their content.
