# Page types

{{ wiki-full-name }} supports multiple page types. You can select a type when creating a page, but you cannot change the type after you save it.

## Page in the old editor {#old-editor}

You can use the old editor to create a common page with text, images, tables, attached files, and more. The old editor partially supports the [visual markup editor](wysiwyg/text-format.md), but primarily uses the [Markdown markup](static-markup.md). If needed, you can [convert your page](page-management/convert-page.md) created in the old editor to a page in the [new editor](pages-types.md#new-editor) format.

Page editing mode in the old editor looks like this:

## Page in the new editor {#new-editor}

The [visual editor](wysiwyg/text-format.md) allows you to work with page text as usual, just as you do in Microsoft Word or Google Docs. If you prefer the [Markdown markup](static-markup.md), you can use it. The new editor, unlike the old one, uses the extended markup version, [{{ yfm }}]({{ yfm-link }}). So there are differences between the old and new editor in the markup reference.

You cannot convert a page created in the new editor into a page in the old editor format.

Page editing mode in the new editor looks like this:

## Table {#grid}

This type allows you to specify data types in columns, sort values, and make cells required. You can use a table directly or [embed it in a page](wysiwyg/tables-format.md).
