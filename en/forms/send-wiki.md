# Adding a response to {{ wiki-name }}


{% note warning %}

Users of [{{ forms-full-name }} for business](forms-for-org.md) can configure integration with {{ wiki-name }}.

{% endnote %}


You can integrate your form with [{{ wiki-name }}]({{ link-wiki }}) to save user responses on a Wiki page. For example, if you are using a form to register participants for an event, you can automatically create a list of participants in {{ wiki-name }}. For more information about Wiki pages, see the [{{ wiki-name }} documentation](../wiki/pages-types.md).

{% note alert %}

Integration will not work if user access to a {{ wiki-name }} page is restricted. In this case, [grant access](../wiki/page-management/access-setup.md) to your page for the service account `@yndx-wiki-cnt-robot`.

{% endnote %}

Settings for sending responses to {{ wiki-name }} differ depending on the response destination: a [{{ wiki-name }} page](#editor) or a [dynamic table](#grid).

## Adding responses to a page {#editor}

To set up adding responses from forms to a {{ wiki-name }} page:

1. Select the form and open the **Integration** tab.

1. Select a [group of actions](notifications.md#add-integration) for which you want to set up sending responses to {{ wiki-name }} and click ![](../_assets/forms/wiki-notification-new.png) **{{ wiki-name }}** at the bottom of the group.

1. Specify the address of the Wiki page where you want to send data from the form. For example: `users/login/my-page`. By default, responses are added to the bottom of the page. To add responses to a specific place on the page:

   1. Insert an [anchor](../wiki/actions/anchor.md) in the place where you want to add responses from the form. For example, `{{a name="form"}}`.

   1. In the {{ wiki-name }} integration settings, append the `#` character and the name of the anchor to the page address like this: `users/login/my-page#form`. Responses from the form will be added to the page after the anchor.

1. In the **Text** field, specify what data to add to the page. You can format your text using [wiki markup](../wiki/static-markup.md).
   You can add to the text a response to a prompt or other data from the form:

   1. Select the field and click ![](../_assets/forms/add-var.png) to the right.

   1. Select a [variable](vars.md) from the list to add to the field. For instance, you can add a user's name and email to the text.

1. To get a link to the Wiki page after filling out the form, enable the **Show messages about the results of actions** option under the action name.

1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.save }}**.

## Dynamic table {#grid}

To set up adding responses from forms to a {{ wiki-name }} dynamic table:

1. Select the form and open the **Integration** tab.

1. Select a [group of actions](notifications.md#add-integration) for which you want to configure responses to {{ wiki-name }} and click ![](../_assets/forms/wiki-notification-new.png) **{{ wiki-name }}** at the bottom of the group.

1. Specify the address of the dynamic table to send the data from the form to. Specify the address without a domain. For example: `users/login/my-page`.

1. In the **Select action** field, specify the table to add the data to.

1. In the **Record data** section, select the column to which you want to add records. You can select more than one column. Below indicate what data you want to add to the table. You can use [wiki markup](../wiki/static-markup.md) in the text. To add to the text a response to a prompt or other data from the form:

   1. In the column text box, click ![](../_assets/forms/add-var.png).

   1. Select a [variable](vars.md) from the list to add to the field. For example, you can add a user's name and email address to the text.

1. In the **Add response to page** field, select where to add the new rows: the beginning or the end of the table.

1. To get a link to the Wiki page after filling out the form, enable the **Show messages about the results of actions** option under the action name.

1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.save }}**.

To send responses to multiple Wiki pages at once, add multiple actions using the ![](../_assets/forms/wiki-notification-new.png) **{{ wiki-name }}** button at the bottom of the page.Â 

If you want data to be sent to {{ wiki-name }} only if the user gave certain responses, [set the conditions](notifications.md#section_xlw_rjc_tbb).
