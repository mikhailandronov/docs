# Exporting an OS Login certificate

You can use a certificate to enable a user or a third-party tool, such as [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) or [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), to use SSH to connect to a VM with OS Login access enabled. To do this, locally export an OS Login certificate and use it to access a VM using a standard SSH client. The exported certificate is valid for one hour.

You can use the exported OS Login certificate to [connect](./os-login.md#connect-via-exported-certificate) to a VM with OS Login access [configured](../vm-control/vm-update.md#enable-oslogin-access).
