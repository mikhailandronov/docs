# Restoring a VM from a backup

{% note info %}

If the current VM is down, [create](../#connect-vm) a new one with a connection to {{ backup-name }} and [restore](non-native-recovery.md) a backup to it. To restore from a backup, the new VM must be in `Running` [status](../../../compute/concepts/vm-statuses.md#list-of-statuses).

{% endnote %}

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where the backup is located.
   1. Select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_backup }}**.
   1. Go to the ![backups](../../../_assets/console-icons/archive.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.backup.label_backups }}** tab.
   1. Next to the backup to restore the VM from, click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.backup.action_recovery }}**.
   1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.backup.field_recover-to-vm }}** field, select the VM you created the backup from. In the list, this VM is marked as `({{ ui-key.yacloud.backup.context_current-vm }})`.
   1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.backup.action_recovery-start }}**.

- CLI {#cli}

   {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. View a description of the CLI command to restore a VM from a backup:

      ```bash
      yc backup backups recover --help
      ```

   1. Get the ID of the appropriate backup:

      {% include [get-backup-id](../../../_includes/backup/operations/get-backup-id.md) %}

   1. Get the ID of the VM to restore:

      {% include [get-vm-id](../../../_includes/backup/operations/get-vm-id.md) %}

   1. Restore the VM from the backup:

      ```bash
      yc backup backups recover \
        --source-backup-id <backup_ID> \
        --destination-instance-id <VM_ID>
      ```

      Where:

      * `--source-backup-id`: ID of the backup to restore the VM from.
      * `--destination-instance-id`: ID of the VM to restore the backup to.

      Result:

      ```text
      ...1s...6s...11s ... 9m4s...9m9s...done (9m9s)
      ```

      For more information about the command, see the [CLI reference](../../../cli/cli-ref/managed-services/backup/backup/recover.md).

- API {#api}

   To restore a VM from a backup, use the [startRecovery](../../backup/api-ref/Backup/startRecovery.md) REST API method for the [Backup](../../backup/api-ref/Backup/index.md) resource or the [BackupService/StartRecovery](../../backup/api-ref/grpc/backup_service.md#StartRecovery) gRPC API call.
