### Pricing formula {#price-formula}

The cost of delivered data events is calculated in proportion to their number.

For example, delivering 17,000 data events will cost:

> 
> 
> (17,000 / 100,000) × $0.288 = 0.17 × $0.288 = $0.05
>
> Total: $0.05

### Examples of cost calculation {#price-example}

{% list tabs %}

- Example 1

   Calculation of the cost of delivering the events of receiving the contents of a {{ lockbox-full-name }} secret encrypted with the {{ kms-full-name }} encryption key:
   * Each time a secret is accessed, two events are delivered: the event of [accessing](./concepts/events-data-plane.md#lockbox) the {{ lockbox-short-name }} secret contents and the event of [decrypting](./concepts/events-data-plane.md#kms) the secret contents using the {{ kms-short-name }} key.
   * Number of times the secret is accessed: 7,000.

   The cost is calculated as follows:

   > 
   > 
   > (2 × 7,000 / 100,000) × $0.288 = 0.14 × $0.288 = $0.04
   >
   > Total: $0.04

   Where:
   * 2: Number of events delivered per a single access to a secret.
   * 7,000: Number of times the secret is accessed.
   * 0.288: Price for delivering 100,000 events.
   * 100,000: Divide to reduce the number of events to a billing unit.

- Example 2

   Calculating the cost of delivering events when using {{ objstorage-full-name }} buckets.

   Total number of delivered events: 25,000. Out of which:
   * Number of [management](./concepts/events.md#objstorage) events transferred when using buckets: 1,000.
      This includes the events of creating and deleting buckets, changing access policies, ACL and encryption settings.

   * Number of [data](./concepts/events-data-plane.md#objstorage) events transferred when using buckets: 24,000.
      This includes the events of creating objects in buckets and changing object tags.

   The cost is calculated as follows:

   > 
   > 
   > ((25,000 - 1,000) / 100,000) × $0.288 = 0.24 × $0.288 = $0.07
   >
   > Total: $0.07

   Where:
   * 25,000: Total number of delivered {{ objstorage-name }} events.
   * 1,000: Number of delivered management events that are not billed.
   * 0.288: Price for delivering 100,000 events.
   * 100,000: Divide to reduce the number of events to a billing unit.
