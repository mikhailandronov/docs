# OS Login

OS Login is a convenient tool for managing SSH connections to [VM instances](../../compute/concepts/vm.md) using {{ iam-short-name }}. Use OS Login to manage SSH access to VM instances without having to create and manage separate SSH keys.

The OS Login agent is based on the [Guest Agent for Google Compute Engine](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/guest-agent). To monitor the changes introduced by the {{ yandex-cloud }} team, see the project's repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yandex-cloud-guest-agent).

{% note info %}

Connecting to a virtual machine with OS Login access enabled requires the user to have the `compute.osLogin` or `compute.osAdminLogin` role.

OS Login associates the VM user's account with the organization's account. To manage access to VM instances, [enable the option](../operations/os-login-access.md) to allow OS Login access at the organization level, then enable it on each VM instance individually.

This way you can easily manage access to instances by assigning roles to users. If you revoke a user's roles, they will lose access to all VM instances within the organization where OS Login access is enabled.

Users or third-party tools, such as [{{ TF }}](https://www.terraform.io/) or [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), can use a standard SSH client to connect to a VM with OS Login access enabled. To do this, [export](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/os-login-export-certificate.md) an OS Login certificate and specify this certificate when connecting to a VM. The certificate is valid for one hour. After this time has elapsed, you will need to export a new certificate to connect to the VM.

OS Login has the following benefits:

* Instant update of access rights when revoking or granting roles.
* Access using short-lived SSH certificates.
* No need to manage SSH keys manually.
* Restoring access to instances if you lose your SSH keys (if you opt to use regular SSH keys instead of OS Login).
* Advanced mode for loading your own SSH keys (upcoming).
